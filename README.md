## Introduction

This terraform module is a work in progress. It's intent to provide the plumbing requirements for deployKF and provision it end-to-end for different use cases.



## Usage

Currently a fully automated e2e deployment is not yet possible, however generally the steps are:

1. Call the module in your terraform state, e.g.:

```
module "deploy-kf" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/flaccid/terraform-deploykf"

  app_of_apps_values  = file("app-of-apps-values.yaml")
  argocd_helm_values  = <<EOF
configs:
  params:
    server.insecure: true

server:
  ingress:
    enabled: true
    annotations:
      cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-production
      ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: 'true'
      nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: "HTTP"
      nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/force-ssl-redirect: "true"
    ingressClassName: nginx
    hosts:
      - argocd.mydomain.com
    tls:
      - hosts:
          - argocd.mydomain.com
        secretName: argocd-mydomain-com-tls
EOF
  install_app_of_apps = true
}
```
Populate `app-of-apps-values.yaml` with the values you need per your use case and environment.

2. Sync the argocd apps per https://www.deploykf.org/guides/getting-started/
3. Profit

### Argo CD UI

Login with the default username (`admin`) and password retrieved using:

```
echo $(kubectl -n argocd get secret/argocd-initial-admin-secret \
  -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 -d)
``` 

### Kubeflow UI
